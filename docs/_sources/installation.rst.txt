Installation
============

The octopus package is available on GitHub, where you can either clone the repository with:
``git clone https://github.com/cuspaceflight/octopus.git``, or you can install with pip:
``pip install git+https://github.com/cuspaceflight/octopus.git``.

The github page can be found here: `https://github.com/cuspaceflight/octopus`_

As the project is in the beta phase, there may be pushes to the repository that come without a new version number. If
you want to be completely up-to-date (and risk unstable releases) you should regularly uninstall and reinstall (this
is not the same as updating with pip).
